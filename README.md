# Ski DIN Calculator

The Ski DIN calculator is used to determine your DIN setting (ski binding release tension). USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. The algorithm uses the 2016/17 Marker DIN chart to calculate the DIN based on skier parameters (height, weight, age, boot sole length, type).

This website was created using React.js. It is still a work in progress.
